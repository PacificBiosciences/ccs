## Is it possible to use HiFi reads to call base modifications?
Base modifications can be inferred from per-base pulse width (PW) and
inter-pulse duration (IPD) kinetics. Running _ccs_ with `--hifi-kinetics`
generates averaged kinetic information for polished reads, independently for
both strands of the insert. Forward is defined with respect to the orientation
represented in ``SEQ`` and is considered to be the native orientation. As with
other PacBio-specific tags, aligners will not re-orient these fields.

Minor cases exist where a certain orientation may get filtered out entirely from
a ZMW, preventing valid values from being passed for that record. In these
cases, empty lists will be passed for the respective record/orientation and
number of passes will be set to zero.

In order to facilitate the use of HiFi reads with base modifications workflows,
we have added an executable in pbbam called `ccs-kinetics-bystrandify` which
creates a pseudo `--by-strand` BAM with corresponding `pw` and `ip` tags that
imitates a normal, unaligned subreads BAM. You can install pbbam from Bioconda
by calling `conda install pbbam`.
