## Does _ccs_ dislike low-complexity regions?
Low-complexity comes in many shapes and forms. A particular challenge for _ccs_
are highly enriched tandem repeats, like hundreds of copies of `AGGGGT`. Prior
_ccs_ v5.0, inserts with many copies of a small repeat likely not generate a
consensus sequence. Since _ccs_ v5.0, every ZMW is tested if it contains a
tandem repeat of length `--min-tandem-repeat-length 1000`. For this, we use
[symmetric DUST](https://doi.org/10.1089/cmb.2006.13.1028) and in particular the
[sdust](https://github.com/lh3/sdust) implementation, but slightly modified. If
a ZMW is flagged as a tandem repeat, internally `--disable-heuristics` is
activated for only this ZMW, and various filters that are known to exclude
low-complexity sequences are disabled. This recovers most of the low-complexity
consensus sequences, without impacting run time performance.
